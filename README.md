# ezfeedback

This app provides businesses to sign up and track feedback from consumers.

How it works:

A business signs up with their preferred survey link. This link becomes a URL in which the businesses
questions will be displayed.

Anyone can see this URL as it is meant for the public. The consumer answers the questions, and the answers are sent into a database.

The user/business can then log in to the site and view all the answers to their questions on that product.

QR code implementation soon to come.

Technologies Used: Express, Mongo, jQuery, AJAX, QR Codes.
